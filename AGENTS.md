# BPB Action Mesh

> **Agent Readiness:** This file contains two kinds of guidance:
> - **Universal rules** — project structure, branching, architecture, and security patterns that apply regardless of what tooling you have.
> - **Workflow recommendations** — tool-specific tips that are helpful when the relevant tools are available, but not required to complete tasks. Use whatever tools you have access to.

Decentralized mesh of ephemeral proxy nodes (VLESS/Hysteria2) on GitHub Actions runners, discovered via libp2p Kademlia DHT. Research experiment — not production.

## Structure

```
src/        Express + Socket.IO dashboard (server.ts, assets/panel/)
node/       libp2p DHT mesh node — discovery + lifecycle
worker/     Cloudflare Worker coordinator — register, heartbeat, subscription
scripts/    CLI: proxy-up.sh, animamesh-connect.sh, proxy-down.sh, proxy-status.sh
.github/    proxy.yml (GHA runner), panel.yml (build/deploy dashboard)
docs/       SPEC-V2-MESH.md, SPEC-V3-ANIMAMESH-BACKEND.md, ANIMAMESH-CLIENT.md
```

## Agent SOP — The Delegate-Verify Loop

This is the critical workflow for any code-change task. **Follow it every time.**

### Step 1: Analyze & Plan

Use structured exploration tools (if available) to understand the codebase before planning changes:

1. Start by exploring the codebase — identify the relevant symbols/files for your task. (If you have a code-indexing or symbol-search tool, use it here instead of brute-reading full files.)
2. Assess blast radius — understand what depends on the symbols you're about to change. Check both direct and transitive dependents.
3. Map module boundaries — know what crosses package boundaries. This repo crosses three packages (root, `node/`, `worker/` with different module systems).

Break into smallest incremental steps. Delegate one step at a time.

### Step 2: Delegate ONE Step (If Sub-Agent Tool Is Available)

When delegating to a sub-agent, every prompt must include:

1. **Repo identifier** — the repo/project name so the sub-agent knows where it's working
2. **Code-tool mandate:** instruct the sub-agent to use structured code-lookup tools (if available) instead of reading full files
3. **Target symbols/files:** exact symbols the sub-agent needs to read or modify
4. **All required context:** the sub-agent is stateless — include everything it needs to complete the task
5. **Token budget:** if your delegation tool supports token caps, set a reasonable limit to keep context focused

Example delegation preamble (adapt to your available tooling):

```
Repo: bpb-action
Use structured lookup for all code exploration — avoid reading full files.
Target symbols: <list symbol_ids>
Include all context the sub-agent needs.
```

Delegate only the immediate next step. Never bundle multiple steps. If work can be parallelized across disjoint files, instruct the sub-agent to fan out.

**Recursive safety:** If you are the spawned sub-agent, do your designated job directly. Do not recursively spawn further sub-agents unless explicitly instructed to "fan out."

### Step 3: ❗ Verify the Result (CRITICAL)

**Never trust a sub-agent's report.** Sub-agents frequently claim success while leaving code unmodified. After every delegated task:

1. **Read the actual file** — use `grep` / `read_file` to confirm the expected code is present. Do not rely on cached or pre-indexed reads.
2. Check blast radius — confirm impact matches expectations by tracing importers and callers of changed symbols.
3. Verify no call site is broken — check references to changed symbols across the project.
4. Re-index or invalidate caches if your tooling requires it after edits.
5. Run tests: `npm test` (currently a no-op stub, but check anyway).

□ **Before committing:** Did I verify with grep that all expected code is actually in the files?

### Step 4: Iterate

- **Approved:** Move to next step (return to Step 2).
- **Revision needed:** Re-delegate with corrective feedback. Instruct the sub-agent to read the current state before editing. **Do not fix code yourself** — delegate the fix so the sub-agent builds correct context.

**Lesson learned — sub-agent false-positive:** A sub-agent for a code-restructuring task reported "all changes applied successfully" but the target file was never modified — only unrelated comments were touched. The missing function body was discovered when verifying by reading the source with `grep`. Always verify the actual output — not just the sub-agent's summary.

## Git Rules

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| Default branch | `main` — push triggers proxy workflow via GHA |
| Layout | Monorepo: root `package.json` owns dashboard; `node/` and `worker/` have own packages |
| Sync | `proxy.yml` runs on `ubuntu-latest`, 45-min timeout; DHT node step is commented out — do not re-enable |

Emergency recovery: push to main or `workflow_dispatch` → `proxy-up.sh` → `curl $COORDINATOR_URL/health` → `proxy-down.sh` to cancel stuck runs.

## Testing Rules

- `npm test` exits 0 (no tests yet)
- When adding tests: place adjacent to source (e.g. `node/src/lifecycle.test.ts`), use same module system as the source package, update the relevant `package.json` test script
- `panel.yml` has `continue-on-error: true` on deploy/release — failures are silently ignored

## Architecture Landmines

| Constraint | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| **DHT is discovery-only** | Never route proxy traffic through libp2p — unanimous consillium agreement |
| **Coordinator is optional** | Every feature must work DHT-only — graceful degradation |
| **No serial multi-hop** | `route: []` was killed by consillium — parallel multiplexing is the resilience model |
| **Ephemeral by design** | Nodes live 15-60 min, no persistent state, identity is per-lifecycle PeerId |
| **Stagger, don't sync** | Random TTLs, jittered announces — no herd behavior |
| **DHT key schema** | `/bpb/v2/{network-id}/{protocol}/{peer-id}` — changing it requires updating both `node/announce.ts` and the spec |
| **Module system mismatch** | Root tsconfig = CommonJS, `node/tsconfig.json` = ES2022 — never mix import styles across packages |
| **`/sub/all` format** | Consumed by Hiddify/v2ray clients — any output change breaks existing subscriptions |

Coordinator API to preserve:

| Endpoint | Method | Auth | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/register` | POST | Bearer | Runner registers proxy config |
| `/heartbeat` | POST | Bearer | Runner refreshes TTL |
| `/sub/all` | GET | None | Hiddify subscription (all proxies) |
| `/sub/{id}` | GET | None | Single proxy subscription |
| `/proxies` | GET | None | JSON list of active proxies |
| `/delete/{id}` | DELETE | Bearer | Remove a proxy record |
| `/health` | GET | None | Service health check |

## Fleet Architecture — Multi-Account Matrix

Animamesh operates across a fleet of throwaway GitHub accounts to distribute proxy runners, avoid rate limits, and reduce the blast radius of any single account being suspended. Each account is self-contained but shares a single coordinator.

### Account Naming & Scope

Accounts follow the pattern `vi70x5` through `vi70x20` (16 accounts total). Each account has:

| Resource | Example | Details |
|---|---|---|
| **GitHub account** | `vi70x5` | Throwaway account with `repo` + `workflow` scopes |
| **Fork repo** | `vi70x5/retry-queue` | Fork of `animamesh/backend`, obfuscated with generic name + innocent README |
| **Cloudflare account** | Same as GH (e.g. `vi70x5`) | Optional — for permanent tunnel domains (`tun.vi70x5.qzz.io`). 2 domains per account via CF partner |
| **Coordinator** | Shared — `bpb-action-coordinator.vi70x3.workers.dev` | One Worker for the whole fleet. Multiple GH accounts deploy runners, all register on the same coordinator |

### Storage Layout

```

```

### How Fleet Management Works

#### Adding an Account (`animamesh-fleet.sh add <token>`)

1. **Auth capture** — Stores the PAT in `~/.animamesh/accounts/<name>/token` and runs `gh auth login --with-token` into a per-account `GH_CONFIG_DIR`
2. **Fork creation** — Forks `animamesh/backend` into `<gh_user>/<random-name>` via GitHub API
3. **Obfuscation** — Renames workflow from `"BPB Action Proxy"` → `"CI Pipeline"`, strips revealing step names via `sed`, and generates an innocent README via static template or optional LLM
4. **Push** — Commits obfuscated code to the fork, using `https://oauth2:<token>@github.com` remote URL to bypass `GH_CONFIG_DIR` git proxy limitations
5. **Meta tracking** — Records `fork_name` and `gh_user` in `~/.animamesh/forks/<name>.meta` for self-contained re-runs

#### Deploying Proxy Runners (`animamesh-fleet.sh deploy`)

1. Reads the fork name and account name from `.meta` files
2. Sets required secrets on the fork via `gh secret set` with explicit `GH_TOKEN` injection:
   - `COORDINATOR_URL` — Worker URL (shared across fleet)
   - `AUTH_TOKEN` — Worker auth token (shared across fleet)
   - `VLESS_UUID` / `HY2_PASSWORD` — per-account, random, generated
   - `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` — optional, for named tunnel mode
3. Calls `gh workflow run proxy.yml` with `--field protocol=<...> --field tunnel=<...>`, using `--repo <gh_user>/<fork_name>` targeting syntax

#### Fleet Coordination (the Shared Coordinator Model)

### Fork Obfuscation Strategy

Since throwaway GitHub accounts are used, the forks need to look unrelated to Animamesh:

1. **Repo name** — Random descriptive name: `retry-queue`, `cloud-sync`, `data-pipe`, `build-cache`, `task-runner`, `devops-toolkit`, `ci-helper`, `action-tester`, `pipeline-orchestrator`, `config-manager`
2. **README** — Static template about a generic CI tool (or LLM-generated on-the-fly)
3. **Workflow** — Renamed to `CI Pipeline` with generic step names: `Install dependencies`, `Setup runtime`, `Start service`, `Setup tunnel`, `Register with registry`
4. **Description** — "Automated build and test pipeline"
5. **Topics** — Unset or set to generic `ci`, `automation`, `devops`

### Cloudflare Account Integration (Planned)

Each GitHub account (`vi70x5`–`vi70x20`) can optionally have a paired Cloudflare account for permanent tunnel domains:

- 2 domains per CF account, provisioned via Cloudflare Partner
- Named tunnels: `mesh-tun-1` → `tun.<gh_user>.qzz.io`, `mesh-tun-2` → `tun.<gh_user>.dpdns.org`
- Credentials stored as `CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_CREDS` secret (base64-encoded JSON) on each fork
- `proxy.yml` switches from trycloudflare random subdomain to named tunnel when creds are present
- Single coordinator Worker (deployed under `vi70x3` account) remains unchanged — Cloudflare accounts are only for tunnel DNS, not for the coordinator

### Authentication Matrix

| Secret | Scope | Where stored | Rotated |
|---|---|---|---|
| GitHub PAT | Per-account | `~/.animamesh/accounts/<name>/token` + `gh` config | Per-session |
| COORDINATOR_URL | Fleet-wide | GH Actions secret on every fork | Rarely |
| AUTH_TOKEN | Fleet-wide | GH Actions secret on every fork | If leaked |
| N2N_COMMUNITY | Fleet-wide | GH Actions secret on every fork | Per-deployment |
| N2N_KEY | Fleet-wide | GH Actions secret on every fork | Per-deployment |
| CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN | Per-account | GH Actions secret on fork | If leaked |
| CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_CREDS | Per-account | GH Actions secret on fork | If leaked |
| VLESS_UUID / HY2_PASSWORD | Per-run | Generated in workflow, posted to coordinator | Every run |

### Operational Notes

- **One coordinator to rule them all** — All runners, regardless of which GH account they ran under, register on the same Worker. This is safe because the Worker is control-plane only (never in the data path) and the AUTH_TOKEN gates write operations.
- **Account suspension ≠ fleet loss** — If `vi70x5` is suspended, the other 15 accounts keep running. Only the coordinator stays up (deployed under `vi70x3`, a separate account).
- **Rate limit distribution** — GitHub API has 5000 req/hr per account. Spreading across 16 accounts gives ~80k req/hr aggregate for workflow dispatches and secret management.
- **No cross-account contamination** — Each fork has its own secrets. There is no shared KV or cross-account token that could compromise the fleet if a single account is breached.
- **`GH_CONFIG_DIR` caveat** — The `gh` CLI stores auth per-account in `~/.animamesh/accounts/<name>/gh/`. However, `git push` via `GH_CONFIG_DIR` silently fails on some forks. The fleet script works around this by embedding the token directly in the remote URL: `https://oauth2:${gh_token}@github.com/<user>/<repo>.git`.

## Credential Rules

- `COORDINATOR_URL`, `AUTH_TOKEN`, `NETWORK_ID` → GitHub Actions secrets only, never in source
- Worker `AUTH_TOKEN` set via `wrangler secret put AUTH_TOKEN` — if absent, worker allows all requests (dev mode)
- `wrangler.toml` KV namespace id is a placeholder — replace after `wrangler kv:namespace create BPB_KV`, don't commit real ids
